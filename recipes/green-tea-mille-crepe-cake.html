    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>28 layers of soft and tender matcha crepes make up this delicious Japanese Matcha Green Tea Mille Crepe Cake that requires no baking at all. Filled with a light chantilly cream, it is both tasty and visually impressive.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Crepes (28 count)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>190 ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>190 ml milk</li>
        <li>5 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>35 grams vegetable oil</li>
        <li>120 grams cake flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp matcha green tea powder</li>
        <li>6 tbsp water</li>
        <li>A generous amount of butter (for the frying pan)</li>
        <li>More matcha powder for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Chantilly cream</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>360 ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>105 grams powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the milk, cream, and sugar on medium heat until sugar is fully dissolved. Take off heat immediately once sugar is dissolved, do not bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Allow milk and sugar mixture to come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Pour into blender.</li>
        <li>Add egg, oil, cake flour and matcha powder into blender.</li>
        <li>Blend until the mixture becomes homogenous. A few pulses should do, do not over blend.</li>
        <li>Pour equal amounts through a sieve into two mixing bowls.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 1 hour or overnight in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Immediately before cooking, add 1-3 tablespoons of water into one bowl of the crepe batter to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan on low-medium heat, using a pastry brush, coat pan generously with butter for the first crepe. Pan is ready when the butter sizzles as it hits the pan. </li>
        <li>Using a small ladle, pour batter onto pan, swirl the batter around until it coats the pan evenly.</li>
        <li>Set timer for 3 minutes. Cook first side for approximately 2 minutes. The crepe will bubble up and once the sides can be picked up with a silicone tong without tearing, the crepe can be flipped with a flat spatula. It will look slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Watch the second side closely. It will cook much faster, about 1 min. Remove from heat before it turns brown.</li>
        <li>Place on cooling rack to cool before stacking on plate.</li>
        <li>For subsequent crepes, coat the pan with a very small dab of butter and repeat steps #10-13.</li>
        <li>Once all the crepes are finished (26-28 in total), set them aside and prepare the cream filling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To prepare the chantilly cream:</h4> 
    <ol>
        <li>Place a mixing bowl and beaters in the freezer to chill. It will help the cream whip better.</li>
        <li>Place cream in the chilled mixing bowl, then beat on low speed until the beater starts leaving light tracks in the cream. Add icing sugar.</li>
        <li>Increase speed to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Stop beating when the cream starts to get stiff and turns from glossy to matte. Do not over whip.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To assemble the cake:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once cream is completed, use immediately.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of cream in between each layer of crepe.</li>
        <li>Place in an air tight container and let set overnight.</li>
        <li>Before serving, dust some matcha powder onto the top layer with a sifter. </li>
        <li>Cut into 8 slices and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
