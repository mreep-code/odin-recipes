    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Takoyaki is a Japanese snack in the shape of little round balls containing small pieces of octopus. The name "takoyaki" literally translates to "octopus-grilled/fried" and some people may call it "grilled octopus balls" or "octopus dumplings."</p>
    <p>Takoyaki is one of the most popular Japanese street foods and is usually sold by street vendors, convenience stores, supermarkets, food courts, and specialty restaurants. There are many regional variations of this dish; for example, while the original Osaka-style does not include any cabbage, other regional variations (Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya, and Tokyo areas) do.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup dried bonito flakes</li>
        <li>2 green onions/scallions</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pickled red ginger</li>
        <li>4.2 oz boiled octopus</li>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tempura scraps</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the takoyaki batter:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups dashi</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Takoyaki Sauce (homemade or store bought)</li>
        <li>Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Dried bonito flakes</li>
        <li>Dried green laver seaweed</li>
        <li>pickled red ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>To prepare the filling:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the bonito flakes into a fine powder and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the green onions into fine slices.</li>
        <li>Mince the red pickled ginger.</li>
        <li>Cut the octopus into 1/2 inch bite-sized pieces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To make the takoyaki batter:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and kosher salt and whisk it all together.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, soy sauce, and dashi.</li>
        <li>Whisk it all together until well blended and transfer the batter to a measuring cup with a handle (or any other pitcher with a spout for easy pouring.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To cook the takoyaki:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the takoyaki pan to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) over medium heat. Using a brush, generously oil the pan's rounded chambers and flat surface on top. When you see smoke rising from the pan, pour the batter to fill the chambers. It’s okay to slightly overfill the cavities with the batter. In the next steps, the batter will likely overflow as you add more ingredients to it.</li>
        <li>Add 1-3 octopus pieces, depending on their size, to each chamber and sprinkle on top the dried bonito flake powder that you ground earlier.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the tempura scraps, green onion, and pickled red ginger on top.</li>
        <li>After 3 minutes or so, when the batter on the bottom of the balls has set and is slightly crisp, use skewers to break the connected batter between each ball. Then, rotate each piece 90 degrees (a quarter turn) toward the bottom of the pan, stuffing the connected dough back into the ball as you turn to help form a ball shape.The uncooked batter will flow out from inside each takoyaki to create another side of the ball.</li>
        <li>After you finish turning them, set a timer for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, rotate them a second time, starting again with the first ball: Turn each takoyaki another 90 degrees toward the bottom of the pan so the remaining uncooked batter pours out into the chamber to complete the ball shape. After turning and cooking for 4 minutes, they are done.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To serve:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer them onto a plate and drizzle the takoyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise on top.</li>
        <li>Finish the dish with a sprinkling of katsuobushi and dried green seaweed and a side of pickled red ginger.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately (but be careful—they're VERY hot inside!)</li>.
    </ol>
