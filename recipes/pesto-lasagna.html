        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pesto Lasagna, also known as Lasagna al Pesto, is a lasagna made of two cheeses, pasta, and a basil pesto.</p>
        <p>Lasagna is typically made with tomato sauce, but using basil pesto as a substitute gives this traditional dish a more mellow and comforting taste. This basil pesto can either be homemade or store bought, although I prefer the homemade version because it is cheaper and quicker to make. Besciamella, a simple white sauce, pairs perfectly with the pesto and lasagna. The two cheeses that I will use, Parmigiano Reggiano and Pecorino Romano, should be mixed with the pesto and besciamella to create the sauce that will be layered with the lasagna. Don't forget to leave the pasta al dente since it will be cooked again after assembly.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>For the pesto sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 pinch of sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of freshly-grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of freshly-grated Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>5 ounces of Ligurian extra virgin olive oil, plus more to store</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the lasagna</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 recipe egg pasta dough, rolled to the thinnest setting on pasta machine, or dry lasagne</li>
            <li>1 recipe besciamella</li>
            <li>1 cup haricot verts or green beans</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Sardo or Pecorino Romano</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>To mix the pesto:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large stone mortar, combine the basil, garlic, and salt, and grind with a pestle until it turns into a paste.</li>
            <li>Add the cheeses and drizzle in the olive oil, beating it with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Store the pesto in jars, topped with extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you may use a food processor to make the pesto. However, be sure to pulse the mixture so that the least amount of heat is generated.</p>

        <h4>To create the lasagna:</h4>
        <p>If making your own pasta:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 portions.</li>
            <li>Roll each one out through the thinnest setting on a pasta machine and lay the sheets on a lightly floured surface to dry for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut the pasta into 5-inch squares and cover with a damp kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot and add 2 tablespoons salt. </li>
            <li>Set up an ice bath next to the stovetop.</li>
            <li>Drop the pasta into the boiling water, 6 or 7 pieces at a time (or according to dry pasta package cooking time), and cook until tender, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the ice bath to cool, then drain on kitchen towels, laying the pasta flat.></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>To assemble the dish:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Bring 6 quarts of water to boil, and add 2 tablespoons of salt</li>
            <li>Set up an ice bath next to the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Boil the haricot verts for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Drain (reserving the hot water), and refresh them in the ice bath.</li>
            <li>Remove the haricots verts, drain well (reserving the ice water), cut them into 1-inch pieces, and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Cut the pasta into 5-inch squares, and drop them into same boiling water as the haricots verts.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta for 1 minute until tender.</li>
            <li>Remove and refresh them in the ice bath.</li>
            <li>Drain the lasagna on towls and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, stir the béchamel, pesto, and grated cheese together until they are well combined.</li>
            <li>Butter 4 gratin dishes, and place one piece of 5-inch pasta on the bottom of each one.</li>
            <li>On top of the pasta, place the following a few haricots verts and 2 tablespoons of the pesto-béchamel-cheese mixture before adding another layer of the pasta.</li>
            <li>Continue with this layering until there are 4 pieces of pasta and 4 layers of haricots verts and pesto.</li>
            <li>Lay one more piece of pasta on top, followed by a spoonful of pesto mixture. </li>
            <li>Put the 4 dishes in the oven, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are bubbling and golden brown on top.</li>
        </ol>
